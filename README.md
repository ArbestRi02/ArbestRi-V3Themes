# ArbestRi's Userstyles
This is where I make WIP userstyles and push beta versions of my styles. Release versions of my styles can be found on https://userstyles.world/user/ArbestRi02.
# Themes as of now
1. Late 2016 for StarTube + V3: Makes StarTube and V3 more faithful to late 2016 by changing icons, colors, pages and more.
2. Material Search Bar for V3: The 2016 material search bar experiement from YouTube, brought into V3.
3. Skeumorphic Theme for V3: I don't work on it anymore. It's more like gradients everywhere than skeumorphism.
4. Update DownDetector Logos: Updates the plenty of outdated logos on DownDetector's home page. Images are from Logopedia.
5. Glass Masthead and Guide for V3: Adds glass effects to V3's search box, masthead and guide.
